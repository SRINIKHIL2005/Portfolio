# Email Configuration
# For Gmail, you need to:
# 1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Google account
# 2. Generate an App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
# 3. Use the App Password (not your regular Gmail password)

EMAIL_USER=dronasrinikhil@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password-here

# Note: When deploying to Vercel, add these as environment variables in your project settings:
